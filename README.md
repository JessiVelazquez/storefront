## Overview and Description

An E-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with its own live API server. We can add or remove items from our cart, both from the main product category pages or from a "details" page for each product. We can view the cart on the "cart" page and see total cost. There is also a form on the cart page that allows a user to initiate the order process.
